<h2 id="suicide-meaning">What is suicide? </h2>
        
   
<p>Well suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death.<br>
Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress.<br>
Somethings that cause stress can be financial difficulties, relationship problems such as breakups, or bullying. This can also happen by abuse, or harassment, from those living in your household, or people that you won't even know. Suicide can also happen from just your thoughts. Your thoughts of not feeling enough, that feeling that there is no light at the end of your tunnel. <br>
Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.<br>
Did you know that over 20% of teenage girls suffer from depression and 100,000 people have committed suicide?
